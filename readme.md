## Catalog Web App

#### Project description
Catalog is a small after-hours project. Initially it was supposed to be a home library manager, but since I found websites such as [libib](https://www.libib.com/), that do exactly what I wanted to make, then I decided to pivot into another direction. (I focus more on learning, than on what I'm building in this project, but still I didn't want to make just a duplicate). My idea for this project right now, is to make it a personal belongings manager, with ability, to descripe e.g. default location of an item in your house or flat. The idea is still in progress, but at this point, I can reuse all my code with no effort, since I'm only managing authentication process right now.

#### Technical description
When it comes to code quality, and technologies I used, there is still a huge amount of work to do. Below, I added a todo list, where I point out things I need to accomplish, to make this project better. Also, when it comes to css, I'm trying to use [airbnb css style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css).

- [ ] Add static types (flow or TypeScript)
- [ ] Create tests
- [ ] Add redux dev tools
- [ ] Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- [ ] Maybe change git workflow in the future. (Right now centralized workflow is enough since I developed this only by myself)

Technologies used:
- react
- react-router
- redux
- ant-design
- webpack
- docker
- scss (BEM)
